## Description

Burger's equation is a fundamental partial differential equation in fluid dynamics and can describe various physical phenomena, including turbulence and shock waves. The equation combines diffusion and advection terms and is given by:

\begin{equation}
    \frac{\partial y}{\partial t} + y \frac{\partial y}{\partial x} = \nu \frac{\partial^2 y}{\partial x^2}
\end{equation}

Where:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \( y \) represents the dependent variable (e.g., velocity or concentration).
    \item \( \nu \) is the kinematic viscosity, a measure of the fluid's resistance to motion.
    \item \( t \) is time.
    \item \( x \) is space.
\end{itemize}
