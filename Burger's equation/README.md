## Description

Burger's equation is a fundamental partial differential equation in fluid dynamics and can describe various physical phenomena, including turbulence and shock waves. The equation combines diffusion and advection terms and is given by:


   $ \frac{\partial y}{\partial t} + y \frac{\partial y}{\partial x} = \nu \frac{\partial^2 y}{\partial x^2}$


Where:

- $y$ represents the dependent variable (e.g., velocity or concentration).
- $\nu$ is the kinematic viscosity, a measure of the fluid's resistance to motion.
- $t$ is time.
- $x$ is space.
