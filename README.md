# Flax-Teal
In this repository there are two folders named Runge-Kutta and Burger's equation. 

In Runge-Kutta folder there is code for solving initial value problem (IVP)
$y' = 1−t^2+y, 0≤t≤ 2, y(0) = 0.5, n = 10$
using the Fourth-Order
Runge-Kutta (RK4) method, also this folder incudes one separate README file for the code.

In Burger's equation folder there is code for solving Burger's equation for fluid flow using RK4, assuming some initial conditions. This folder also includes one separate README file for this particular code.

Note: All code has been written in Rust
